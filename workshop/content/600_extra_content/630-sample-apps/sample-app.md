In this chapter you will deploy two sample applications to separate node groups 

```bash
cd ~/environment/tfekscode/extra/sampleapp2
```

Initialize Terraform - note in the output that the **kubernetes** provider is also installed
```bash
terraform init
```

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note from the output that:

* The pods are deployed to  110.64.x.x (node group 1) and 10.0.x.x addresses (node group 2).
* The services are exposing port 80.
* The deployment is referencing a private ECR repository belonging to your account.


**If you see pods apparently stuck in "ContainerCreating" mode for a minute or more try the following:**


{{%expand "Expand here to see the fix" %}}


```bash
cd ~/environment/tfekscode/extra/eks-cidr2
./reannotate-nodes.sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment deployment1-2048 -n game1-2048
kubectl rollout restart deployment deployment2-2048 -n game2-2048
cd ~/environment/tfekscode/extra/sampleapp2
```

Enable port forwarding so we can see the application in out Cloud9 IDE:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/service2-2048 8080:80 -n game2-2048
```
{{< output >}}
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
Handling connection for 8080
{{< /output >}}

Preview the running (port-forwarded service) application from the cloud 9 IDE"

`Preview` -> `Preview Running Application`
![tf-state](/images/andyt/game-2048-0.jpg)

You should then see the app running in the browser 

![tf-state](/images/andyt/game-2048-1.jpg)


As the Terraform files are similar to the previous section they are not explained here.

----

## Cleanup


Interrupt the port forwarding with **ctrl-C**

Then use Terraform to delete the Kubernetes resources:
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
