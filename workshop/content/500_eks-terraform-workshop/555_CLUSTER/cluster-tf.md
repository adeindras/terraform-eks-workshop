```
cd ~/environment/tfekscode/cluster
```

Initialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
```
{{< output >}}
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (hashicorp/null) 3.0.0...
- Downloading plugin for provider "tls" (hashicorp/tls) 3.0.0...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 3.20.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.null: version = "~> 3.0"
* provider.tls: version = "~> 3.0"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Validate the Terraform code
```
terraform validate
```
{{< output >}}
Success! The configuration is valid.
{{< /output >}}

Plan the deployment:
```
terraform plan -out tfplan
```
{{< output >}}
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

data.terraform_remote_state.net: Refreshing state...
data.terraform_remote_state.iam: Refreshing state...

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: tfplan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "tfplan"
{{< /output >}}

You can see from the plan the following resources will be created

* An EKS Cluster
* Configure the cluster with an OIDC provider and add support for ISRA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
* A null resource which runs a small script to test connectivity to EKS with nmap and write the local .kubeconfig file
  

Build the environment:
```
terraform apply tfplan
```
